# cssubtract

A flask web app made in python made to completely remove css from almost any website for devices that cannot load websites with huge css like Amazon Kindle's.

If you wanna host it on your own, on line 6 in main.py change the url to the actual url of your server for example:

> url = 'https://epicserver.com:69420'
